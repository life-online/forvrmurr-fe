          Forvr Murr began with late-night voice notes about scents that made us
          feel something. We’re two women from Lagos, Nigeria with a shared
          belief: fragrance should never be inaccessible, boring, or
          intimidating.

              Ayodeji is known for her friend-first work for Forvr. Her
              communication ethos shapes Murr’s every move. Passionate about art
              and perfume as a method of archiving, she pulls references from a
              catalog of cinema, opera, and oral tradition. A trained writer,
              Ayodeji has told scent stories for Google, Armani, and more. She
              self-published a tiny perfume glossary with the fictional Queen of
              the Night by The Merchant of Venice.

              Lamide is an emotional scholar and scent researcher. Her scent lab
              is the gap between self-recognition and risk. She’s spoken at
              Harvard and written scent reviews that read like tiny memoirs. Her
              nose is guided by abstraction, intuition, and the quiet. She
              describes her scent development process for Forvr as: fragrance
              like it’s a spiritual gift.
