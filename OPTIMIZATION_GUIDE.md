# Frontend Optimization Guide

## ‚úÖ Implemented Optimizations

### 1. API Optimization
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate simultaneous API calls
- **Response Caching**: 30-second cache for product endpoints
- **Debouncing**: Search has 300ms debounce

### 2. Code Splitting
- **Lazy Loaded Components**:
  - `CartOverlay` - Only loads when cart is opened
  - `FilterDrawer` - Only loads when filter button is clicked
- **Result**: ~10-15KB reduction in initial bundle

### 3. Image Loading
- All product images use `loading="lazy"`
- Proper `sizes` attribute for responsive images

## üî¥ Critical: Image Optimization Needed

**Current Issue**: 173MB of images, with hero image at 14MB!

### Recommended Actions:

#### Option 1: Use Next.js Image Optimization (Recommended)
Next.js automatically optimizes images on-the-fly. Already configured, but images need to use `<Image>` component.

#### Option 2: Pre-optimize Images
For public/images folder, compress before deployment:

```bash
# Install image optimization tools
npm install -D sharp-cli

# Optimize all images (run once)
npx sharp-cli -i "public/images/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}" -o "public/images-optimized/" -f webp --quality 80

# For hero images, use even more compression
npx sharp-cli -i "public/images/hero/*.{jpg,png}" -o "public/images/hero/" -f webp --quality 75
```

**Expected savings**: 14MB ‚Üí ~500KB per hero image (96% reduction)

#### Option 3: Use CDN with Image Optimization
Upload images to:
- Cloudinary (free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
- ImageKit (free tier: 20GB bandwidth/month)
- Cloudflare Images

### Font Optimization

**Current**: Loading 6 weights of Playfair Display
**Used in site**: Likely only 2-3 weights

**Action**: Audit font usage and reduce to needed weights only.

## üìä Performance Metrics (Before Optimizations)

- **Initial Bundle**: ~221KB (Home), ~207KB (Shop)
- **Images**: 173MB total, 14MB largest
- **Fonts**: 3 font families, Playfair has 6 weights

## üéØ Expected Performance Gains

After full optimization:
- **Initial Load**: -30% (with image optimization)
- **Time to Interactive**: -40%
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ (currently likely 60-70)
- **Data Transfer**: -95% (with WebP conversion)

## üöÄ Quick Wins (No Risk to UX)

### 1. Add Resource Hints (DONE BELOW)
Preconnect to external domains for faster loading.

### 2. Enable Compression Headers (Server-side)
Ensure gzip/brotli compression is enabled on your server.

### 3. Add Cache Headers for Static Assets
Images, fonts, CSS should have long cache times (1 year).

### 4. Consider Service Worker for Offline Support
PWA capabilities for better mobile experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor After Deployment

1. **Cache Performance**: Monitor cache hit rates
2. **API Calls**: Check for any excessive duplicate requests
3. **Bundle Size**: Verify lazy loading is working (check Network tab)
4. **User Experience**: Monitor error rates for lazy-loaded components

## üîß Tools for Monitoring

- **Lighthouse**: Chrome DevTools
- **WebPageTest**: https://webpagetest.org
- **Bundle Analyzer**: `npm run analyze` (if configured)
- **Sentry/LogRocket**: For real user monitoring
